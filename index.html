				  Bedabots is a unique take on the not-safe-for-work visual
                  novel genre, currently in development. The story is
                  beautifully rendered in a large amount of expertly drawn,
                  full-sized comic pages, which appear panel-per-panel as the
                  narration progresses. The game tells the thrilling tale of a
                  young adult called Himo Kone, moving from his rural farm home
                  to a futuristic mega-city where attractive robots live
                  side-by-side with their human masters.
                </p>

                  On top of a plethora of gorgeous pieces of artwork
                  accompanying the bulk of the storyline, the adult-rated scenes
                  of Bedabots are depicted through high-resolution pixel
                  animations, meticulously hand-crafted via a custom-made 3D to
                  2D pipeline. Each character has a fully-rigged model, used to
                  create animations which are then edited frame-by-frame to
                  produce incredibly detailed results. Never before has making
                  love to robots looked so good!

				  The world of Bedabots is a technologically advanced one. A
                  globe-spanning conglomerate, named the Azuki Corporation, has
                  developed the technology needed to mass-produce fully-sentient
                  synthetic robot models. These robots are called Bedabots, and
                  they have become a major part of everyday life ever since
                  their inception!

				  Hundreds of radically different models carry out thousands of
                  diverse duties. From crunching tremendous amounts of data to
                  driving taxis around, from brewing the perfect cup of coffee
                  to spearheading elite anti-terrorism units; there's a Bedabot
                  purpose-built for every single task imaginable. They all share
                  one thing in common: they were made to serve their human
                  masters in more ways than one. After all, why would you make a
                  bot you can't bed?

				  Throughout the story, the main character will be encountering
                  many different Bedabots; a lot of which may end up being
                  bedded by him at one point or another. While Himo's primary
                  goal is to make a name for himself in the capital city of
                  Mintai, he won't hesitate to leave a mark on as many robots as
                  he can along the way! As a virile young adult in the prime of
                  his life, it's his prerogative to bed'em all!

				  All of these and many more will be encountered by Himo during
                  his stay in Mintai city. This broad set of attractive,
                  appealing synthetic girls serve as the love interests in
                  Bedabots, though the road to bedding them will take many
                  different forms. A casual fling here, a long-term romance
                  there, a blossoming friendship with benefits, a robot that has
                  the hots for you, and another that's icy cold. Which will be
                  your favorite?
				</p>
				<img class="img-corner eyes-img" src="img/red_eyes.png" alt="Red eyes">
				<p>
				  Of course, not all Bedabots will be inherently friendly
                  towards the newcomer in town. Some see value only in corporate
                  ranking, others treat Himo like yet another customer. A
                  special case are the bots personally bought and personally owned by him.
				  They might cost an arm and a leg, but their company
                  alone is worth every penny; let alone their unwavering loyalty
                  to their one and only master.
